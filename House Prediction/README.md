## Key Components

### 1. Machine Learning Model
- **Built Using**: Scikit-learn and Linear Regression.
- **Key Concepts Implemented**:
  - **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values, standardized data, and removed inconsistencies.
  - **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Enhanced model accuracy by eliminating extreme values.
  - **Feature Engineering**: Created meaningful features to improve predictions.
  - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduced redundant features for optimized model performance.
  - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilized GridSearchCV to identify the best model parameters.
  - **K-Fold Cross Validation**: Ensured robustness through systematic model validation.

### 2. Backend Development
- **Framework**: Python Flask.
- Developed an HTTP server to expose the machine learning model through RESTful endpoints.
- The server dynamically processes user inputs and returns predicted prices in real time.

### 3. Frontend Development
- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Designed a user-friendly interface where users can input:
  - Home square footage.
  - Number of bedrooms.
  - Additional features.
- Integrated JavaScript to send AJAX requests to the Flask server and display predictions dynamically.
